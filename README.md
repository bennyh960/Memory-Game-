# Memory-Game

In this project, we were asked to work as a team of 3 developers to create a "memory-game".
Our Game follows the requirements described below. (some were “must do” and other were optional)

## Must do

1. The game must follow the traditional logic and rules of memory games: 12 cards, combined of 6 identical pairs, are distributed randomly on the game board, with their “faces” down. The user clicks on two cards in each round. The click flips the cards and the user tries to find couples of identical cards.
2. The cards must flip by an animation revoked by a click.
3. At the end of each round of 2 chosen cards, the two cards must be displayed for a couple of seconds before they become “hidden” again.
4. The game must be responsive for different screen sizes.
5. Reset game button must be added.

## Optional

1. The game stores the highest score in the browser (in local storage).
2. Shuffling the cards has an animation added.
3. Each action in the game is accompanied by sound effects.
4. Different levels are suggested to the player to choose from. Each level displays a different number of cards.
5. There is an option of two players.
6. A pop up window displays a message to the user, once all pairs are discovered.
